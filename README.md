Queens' Vernacular
This is a project to encode The Queens' Vernacular, a 1972 dictionary of gay slang written by Bruce Rodgers. The project uses XML and TEI Lex-0. The most completely encoded file is a portion of the dictionary, using only definitions in the text related to Lesbians. 
Lesbian.xml is the fully XML encoded lesbian-related portion of The QV. 
QVBRbiographicalarchives is a PDF of biographical information related to the author, scanned from his papers at the GLBT Historical Society
June Murphy QV DAH Thesis.pdf is the file containing my thesis which describes the process of encoding a piece of the dictionary and publishing the zine.
